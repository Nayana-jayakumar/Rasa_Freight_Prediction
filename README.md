In today's fast-paced world, logistics companies face increasing demands for efficient communication and customer support.
To address this challenge,I propose the development of a logistic chatbot using Rasa, a conversational AI framework, with the capability to predict freight values. 
The chatbot aims to assist users in managing logistics-related tasks, such as querying shipment statuses, obtaining shipping quotes, and predicting freight costs.. 
This chatbot will leverage natural language understanding (NLU) and machine learning (ML) techniques to interpret user messages, automate responses, and assist users with various logistics-related inquiries.
The project will follow these key steps:
1.	Rasa Setup: Initialize a Rasa project and configure intents, entities, and dialogue management to handle logistics-related queries.
2.	Data Collection and Model Training: Collect historical freight data and train machine learning models to predict freight costs based on relevant parameters.
3.	Integration: Integrate the predictive model with the Rasa chatbot using custom actions to enable real-time freight value prediction.
4.	Testing and Refinement: Test the chatbot extensively to ensure accuracy and reliability, making iterative improvements based on feedback.
5.	Deployment: Deploy the chatbot on relevant platforms, such as company websites or messaging apps, to provide 24/7 customer support
